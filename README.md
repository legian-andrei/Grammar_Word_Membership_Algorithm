# Grammar Word Membership Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of an algorithm that determines whether a given word belongs to a specified grammar. The project aims to provide a mechanism to validate word membership in a grammar, showcasing its correctness and efficiency.

## Overview
The implemented algorithm offers the following functionality:
### Word Membership Verification: 
Validation of whether a console-given word belongs to a given grammar by analyzing its structure and rules.

## Features
### Algorithm Implementation: 
Complete implementation of the word membership verification algorithm.
### Input Flexibility: 
Support for user-provided grammars and words for validation.
### Efficiency: 
Efficient handling of grammar rules and word parsing for quick validation.
